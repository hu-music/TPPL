        <div class="page-title">Figure 8: Transfer based on one piece of the user’s favorite music</div>
        <p>
          Fig. 8 demonstrates the example where the transferred music is
          generated based on one piece of the user’s favorite music and one piece of randomly selected music.
          The transferred music develops its unique characteristics while effectively inheriting characteristics
          from the user’s favorite music and the input music. Specifically, the transferred music preserves
          “rising-falling contour” from the user’s favorite music, which is a unique melody feature of this
          music. The transferred music also preserves overlapping notes and the 3/4 time signature from the
          input music by containing the same music structure of each bar. As for the uniqueness, the most
          noticeable difference is its new melody with a different rhythm pattern, which is emphasized in orange
          parentheses. For example, the first four notes consist of two quarter notes and two following eighth
          notes, which conveys a soothing, undulating and romantic feel. The continuous appearance of this
          pattern reinforces this feeling, thus creating a style that is coherent and naturally different from the
          two source pieces. Although some melodic features contain in the new melody, the transferred
          music has developed a completely different “melodic outline”, giving a comfortable and smooth
          sense of hearing.

        <div class="page-title">Figure 9: Transfer based on two pieces of the user’s favorite music.</div>
        <p>
          Fig. 9 demonstrates the example where the transferred music is
          generated based on two pieces of the user’s favorite music and one piece of randomly selected music.
          The transferred music preserves “falling-rising-falling contour” from two pieces of the user’s favorite
          music, rhythmic patterns and the 4/4 time signature from the input music. However, characteristics
          from three source pieces are reorganized, fused and subtly integrated into a new melody. Specifically,
          the “falling-rising-falling” contours from the user’s favorite music are subtly combined into a new
          wave-like melodic outline, which brings different and complex auditory effects, creating emotional
          ups and downs.

        <p>
          Based on these examples, we see that the transferred music share similar features with their source
          pieces in terms of melodic contour, rhythmic pattern and time signature. However, most visible
          similarities show flexible changes in note-level details such as pitch and duration. In addition, the
          transferred music develops new features that are not present in the original music, which results in a
          distinct and novel feeling compared to original music.
          <br>
          However, the model also has limitations. If there are more than one piece of favorite music, the
          model tends to learn common music patterns without distinct difference. For example, in Fig. 9, two
          pieces of user’s favorite music contain similar ‘’falling-rising-falling” patterns though the absolute
          pitch value might be different. If the user’s favorite music is diverse, the model tends to “smoothing
          over” distinct features or learn features from one input. This is because the model tends to learn
          common features among all music samples and transfer the input music to fit common features. If
          the difference among the user’s favorite music is too large, the model tends to follow those common
          features while ignore differences.
